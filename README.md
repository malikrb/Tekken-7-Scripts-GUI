primarily utilizes **ctypes**, and **pymem** to interact  
with the game's native virtual memory.

This program reads the game's virtual memory in order to  
determine what side the player is on, and determine which  
scripts should be used when using one of the bound script keys. 

### Automatic Side Switch/Control Swap

any, they want to use while playing.

- [x] Find a reliable way to produce executable versions of the program
- [ ] ...

## Forever Todo
- [ ] bugfixes
- [ ] improve execution speed/reliability of keys

## Ambitious?
- [ ] wrap c++ version of SendInput into a custom module in place of pynput
