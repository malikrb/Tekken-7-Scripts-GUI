## TODO
- Add more characters
- Make overlay only display over Tekken game while Tekken HWND is active
- Find address of 'in-game' bool so that scripts only work inside of a match
- Find a reliable way to produce executable versions of the program
- ...

## Ambitious?
- wrap c++ version of SendInput into a custom module in place of pynput
